R codes associated with the paper *On alleviating spatial confounding issues with the Bayesian Lasso*, which can be accessed from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367342855_On_alleviating_spatial_confounding_issues_with_the_Bayesian_Lasso.

Folder NIMBLE_codes contains the codes for the null model, spatial model, and spatial Lasso model described in the paper. The files *1 Null model.R*, *2 Spatial model.R*, and *3 Spatial LASSO model.R* allow building the data for the analysis and calling the corresponding NIMBLE functions for fitting the respective models.
