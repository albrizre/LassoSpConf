R codes associated with the paper *On alleviating spatial confounding issues with the Bayesian Lasso*, published in...

Folder **NIMBLE_codes** contains the codes for the null model, spatial model, and spatial Lasso model described in the paper. The files *1 Null model.R*, *2 Spatial model.R*, and *3 Spatial LASSO model.R* allow building the data for the analysis and calling the corresponding NIMBLE functions for fitting the respective models. The codes are prepared for the Slovenia case study shown in the paper, but can be easily adapted for the Greater London case study also included in the paper. Folder **Data** contains the data from both case studies (*slovenia.rda* for the Slovenia case study; *data_london.rda* and *districts.rda* for the Greater London case study).
